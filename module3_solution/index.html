		<p>In part one of the this lecture we wrote
the HTML for the first cell in our grid, in this lecture we're going
to start styling that cell. Okay so for now we have only one cell so
let's go ahead and grab this and copy it, so we at least have two cells
to take a look at in the browser. Let's save that, and
let's go to the browser. And, here we are. So, we see that we have our picture here. Picture with what looks like an egg roll. With to the right of it, we have our
title of the menu and some lorem ipsum text that's going to be a description
with, it's not really styled yet. This D01 is sitting all the way here,
Instead of down here and this is not styled 100% either. So let's go back to the code editor and
give it some styles. First of all, let's give the second cell
instead of d1, let's give it a d2 so we can understand
the difference between the two. Let's go open our styles.css and I already have some pre-made styles
that I prepared before the lecture. So let's go ahead and copy and paste them
right under our menu category styles. Let's go find them real quick. They should be under home,
menu categories, page. And here it is so let's go ahead and
paste it right here and what we're going to do is we're
going to comment them out so we'll go one by one and
explain them a little bit better that way. Let's comment them out right here and the first thing we want to
do is the menu item tile. So the menu item tile is this one
right here its that single cell grid, in other words that's this whole thing
that is this single cell grid right here. So what we're doing here is I want
the margin bottom to be 25 pixels, so basically what we're doing is we're saying
I want to separate this a little bit from the next row even though it's not a
technically bootstrap grid row it's going to be a next row just because some of the
items or a lot of these items are going to start spilling over to the next line and
there is going to be two of them per line. Okay. This hr here, the item tile hr,
should only show up when we're squeezing the browser past, I believe the small,
when it gets to be extra small. So let's save it and
take a look at our browser and let's see what's going on here. Let's squeeze the browser a little bit and
see if that hr shows up. And when we get to super small,
the chart there shows up to visually separate the first item
from the second item and so on. So let's go ahead and
stretch it back out and go back to our code editor and
let's style the pressing here. Let's remove this down
the line right here. In fact that's actually those
are two pricing type of styles so let's style them together, okay so
the first thing we're doing is the menu item tile that is followed
by menu item price. So the menu item price that is sitting
inside of the element with a class name menu a new item tile,
let's go take a look at the HTML of that. So the menu item tile is right here and
the menu item price is right there. So basically, we're targeting this thing
right here, this dip where the prices are. So let's go back to styles.css. And what we're doing is we're
increasing it's font a little bit. Aligning it to the right because we
wanted to align to the right over here, to the right of this picture. So we're aligning it to the right. And we're giving it
a margin top negative 15. And a margin right of negative 15, so that is probably something that you will
probably see that we need to adjust. In fact, let's go ahead and comment that out just to see what
would happen if we didn't have that. Let's go ahead and comment that out. And let's go back to the code editor. Well actually before we do that,
remember that stand that we had, the kind of unit portion,
either pint or quart. Well we're just making that smaller. That's how we're targeting it, we're
saying that inside the menu item price is a span, and that span should
have a font size that's smaller. So let's save that and
go back to our browser. And it looks pretty good. We see that we have the pints and
the quarts smaller. These things are a little bit bigger. The picture is done pretty well so far,
so I don't remember why I coded up these margins when I prepared to code for
this lecture so I'm going to just leave them off for now let's go ahead and
keep going in styling some more things. So let's go ahead and
move this over here and actually these two things probably go together very
well so let's leave those alone together. And so we're styling here is the picture. So let's move that up. So we're styling the picture. First of all remember that
picture is going to have a little sign at the bottom right of
the item number that corresponds to their, to the restaurant's existing menu. So for that we need to make the container
element which is this item photo, .menu-item-photo, position: relative;. So we're making that position relative,
giving it a nice maroon border, two pixel border. Again, if anything overflows,
we're going to go ahead and clip that, make it padding zero,
move the margin 15 pixels. To the left, meaning margin right will
be moved to the left a little bit. And the margin left we'll leave as auto. So this is something that's going to
basically separate nicely between the left side of our cell, and the right
side of our cell where the description is. We'll give it a nice margin
bottom of 20 pixels or so. And the maximum width of 250 pixels. Let's go ahead and take a look at the HTML of the menu
item photo, right here, menu item photo. And you see that we made
the image responsive. Well the image is 250 pixels wide. We don't want the image to be any bigger
than that, otherwise this is going to become pixelated and the layout is
probably going to get messed up as well. So that is why we're saying that
the maximum width it can ever go is 250 pixels. Don't stretch this element anymore. Okay, then there's the menu
item photo followed by a div. Well let's take a look as
to what we're targeting. So the menu item photo is right here. And the div is that kind
of corresponding ID of the menu that's corresponding
to the restaurant's menu.
